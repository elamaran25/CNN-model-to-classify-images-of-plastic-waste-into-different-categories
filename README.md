# 🌍 Waste Management Classification using CNN

This project is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based Waste Classification System** that categorizes waste into **Recyclable** and **Organic Waste**. It was developed as part of my **AICTE Internship** in collaboration with **Edunet Foundation and Shell**.

## 🚀 Project Overview
Waste misclassification is a major environmental issue, leading to inefficient recycling processes. This project utilizes **Deep Learning (CNN)** to automate waste classification based on image inputs, making waste segregation more efficient and accurate.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand the implementation of CNN for image classification.
- Train a model to classify waste into recyclable and organic categories.
- Analyze model performance and optimize training epochs to improve accuracy.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍  
- **TensorFlow & Keras** 🤖  
- **OpenCV** 📷  
- **NumPy & Pandas** 📊  
- **Google Colab** ☁️ *(for model training and execution)*
- **Kaggle Dataset** 📂  

## 📌 Methodology
1. **Dataset Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Images resized and normalized for CNN input.
   - Data augmentation applied to improve generalization.
   - Dataset Link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data/data

2. **Model Development**
   - CNN model trained using convolutional layers for feature extraction.
   - Softmax activation function used for multi-class classification.

3. **Training & Optimization**
   - Model trained on **Google Colab** with different epoch values to balance accuracy and loss.
   - Hyperparameter tuning performed to improve performance.

## 🏆 Results & Observations
- The model successfully classifies waste images into recyclable or organic categories.
- Some misclassification occurs due to dataset limitations and image similarities.
- Future improvements can include **fine-tuning the model, adding more data, or using transfer learning.**

## 📥 Installation & Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/CNN-Waste-Management.git
   cd CNN-Waste-Management
   ```

2. **Open Google Colab & Upload Notebook**  
   - Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
   - Upload `Waste_Management_Using_CNN.ipynb`
   - Connect to a GPU runtime *(recommended for faster training)*

3. **Install Dependencies in Colab**  
   Run the following in a Colab cell:  
   ```python
   !pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy pandas
   ```

4. **Train the Model & Predict**
   - Run all notebook cells sequentially.
   - Upload an image to test the classification.

## 🔥 Improvisations & Future Scope
Since this project follows a structured model provided by my internship mentor, I focused on:
- Understanding CNN-based image classification.
- Adjusting **training epochs** to optimize model accuracy.
- Identifying areas for **future improvements**, including better dataset balance and fine-tuning.
